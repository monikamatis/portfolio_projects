    <h2>In short:</h2>
    <p>
        I am a professional skipper with nursing background 
        <i>(and multiple other work experiences - I've been 
        a London cab driver and a lorry driver for a while)</i>
        who came back to software development after almost 30 years since 
        studying Applied Computer Science (back in mid-1990s). 
        Working on my own project with my partner, 
        (very) senior Python developer and intensively re-learning 
        everything I've forgotten 
        as well as all the new, cool stuff I never had a chance 
        to play with before.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am involved in a couple of large projects, an innovative 
        Scottish start-up 
        behind the first worldwide, AI-powered tourist guide 
        (check it here: 
        
        <a href="https://cityexplorer.app">CityExplorer App</a>
        
        ) as well as a large, all-electric catamaran which is being developed 
        by me and 
        
        <a href="https://marysia.app">Marysia Software Limited</a>
        
        as our common research and development platform for our new projects
        (both software and hardware!).
    </p>
    <p>
        Slowly preparing to launch my own start-up in Israel.
